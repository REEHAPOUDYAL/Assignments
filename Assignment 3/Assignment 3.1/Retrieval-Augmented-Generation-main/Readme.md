# My Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Project
This repository contains my implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. This project was a hands-on assignment to build a system that can answer questions by first retrieving relevant information from a custom knowledge base and then using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a grounded response.

# Project Overview
In this project, I focused on creating an end-to-end RAG system. The core idea behind RAG is to enhance the capabilities of LLMs by giving them access to external, up-to-date, and specific information. This helps prevent the LLM from "hallucinating" (making up facts) and ensures its answers are based on verifiable data.

# My pipeline involves:

Data Ingestion: Loading and processing documents to create a searchable knowledge base.

Information Retrieval: Finding the most relevant pieces of information given a user's question.

Answer Generation: Using an LLM to formulate an answer based on the retrieved context.

# Interactive Interface: Providing a user-friendly way to interact with the system.

Key Concepts I Used & Implemented
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): The overarching architecture where I combined a retrieval component with a generative LLM. This allows the system to look up information before answering.

Text Chunking: I broke down large documents into smaller, manageable "chunks" of text. This is crucial for efficient retrieval, as LLMs have context window limits, and searching smaller, focused pieces of text is more effective.

Embeddings: I used pre-trained embedding models (e.g., from sentence-transformers or Hugging Face) to convert text chunks (and user queries) into dense numerical vectors. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text, allowing for similarity searches.

Vector Database (e.g., ChromaDB/FAISS): I utilized a vector database to store these text embeddings. This database allows for fast and efficient "similarity search," meaning I can quickly find text chunks whose embeddings are most similar to a given query's embedding.

Large Language Models (LLMs): I integrated an LLM (e.g., from transformers or via an API like OpenAI/Hugging Face Inference API) to perform the "generation" part of RAG. The LLM receives the user's question and the retrieved relevant text chunks as context to formulate its answer.

Streamlit: I built an interactive web application using Streamlit. This provided a simple and effective user interface for uploading documents, asking questions, and seeing the RAG system's responses in real-time.

# Important Things
Data Ingestion Pipeline (ingest.py):

Wrote ingest.py to handle the process of taking raw data (e.g., PDF documents, or potentially web-crawled content if I extended it for that) and preparing it for the RAG system.

This script performs text extraction, chunking (splitting documents into smaller, overlapping segments), and then generates embeddings for each chunk.

Finally, it loads these embeddings and their corresponding text into a vector database (e.g., ChromaDB, as is common for local RAG setups), making them ready for retrieval.

# Interactive RAG Application (app.py):

I developed app.py using Streamlit to create the user-facing interface.

This application allows users to:

Load the pre-indexed knowledge base.

# Type in a question.

Receive an answer generated by the RAG pipeline.

Behind the scenes, app.py takes the user's question, converts it into an embedding, queries the vector database for relevant chunks, and then sends these chunks along with the question to the LLM for final answer generation.

Integration of Key Libraries: I successfully integrated and utilized key Python libraries such as transformers (for LLMs and embeddings), langchain (or similar frameworks for RAG orchestration), chromadb (or FAISS for vector storage), and streamlit for the UI.

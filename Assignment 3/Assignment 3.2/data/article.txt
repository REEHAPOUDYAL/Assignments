Renewable energy refers to power derived from resources that are naturally replenished,
such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat. Unlike fossil fuels, renewable energy sources 
do not emit greenhouse gases during operation. The adoption of renewable energy technologies has been growing rapidly 
due to concerns about climate change, air pollution, and energy security. Solar and wind power have become cost-competitive 
with conventional energy in many parts of the world. Transitioning to renewables offers significant environmental benefits and 
can create economic opportunities in manufacturing and installation.

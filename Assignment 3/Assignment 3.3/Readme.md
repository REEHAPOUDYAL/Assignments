Text Classification Fine-tuning with Transformers
This repository contains my project focused on fine-tuning a pre-trained Transformer model for a text classification task. Specifically, I explore different fine-tuning techniques and analyze the critical trade-offs between model accuracy, training time, and memory usage.

Project Overview
The goal of this project was to understand the practical aspects of adapting powerful pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) for specific downstream tasks. Text classification is a fundamental NLP problem, and fine-tuning offers a highly effective solution. I implemented and experimented with different approaches to fine-tuning, aiming to gain insights into how various techniques impact performance metrics and resource consumption.

# Key Concepts & My Implementation
Pre-trained Transformers: I utilized a pre-trained Transformer model (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, or a similar model from Hugging Face's transformers library) as the foundation for my classification task. Leveraging these models allows for high performance without training from scratch.

Fine-tuning: The core of this project involved adapting the pre-trained model to a new, specific dataset for text classification. This process involves continuing the training of the pre-trained model's weights on the target task.

Text Classification: I applied the fine-tuned model to a classification task (e.g., sentiment analysis, intent classification, or topic classification). This involves assigning a predefined category label to a given piece of text.

Dataset Preparation: I handled the necessary steps to prepare the text classification dataset, including tokenization (converting text into numerical tokens suitable for the Transformer model) and formatting data for batch processing.

Training Loop Implementation: I set up a training loop using PyTorch (or TensorFlow, depending on the transformers backend) to manage the fine-tuning process, including forward passes, loss calculation, backpropagation, and optimization.

# Performance Analysis: A key aspect of this project was to analyze the trade-offs between:

Accuracy: Overall, the analysis highlighted that fine-tuning Transformer models can lead to high accuracy (up to ~93.42% in my experiments), but the performance is highly sensitive to the specific fine-tuning configuration and hyperparameters.

Memory Usage: The computational memory (GPU memory) required during training.
I investigated how different fine-tuning techniques (e.g., full fine-tuning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning like LoRA if explored, different learning rates, batch sizes) impacted these metrics.
